UDACITY SUNSHINE APP RECREATED 

Built from the lesson learnt from Udacity Android Intermediate level app developer program. Feel free to contribute and modify the source code. 
This app connects to https://openweathermap.org/ api to get the weather condition. The user enters the city of choice and gets returned back results displaying the weather data.
